# Contributing

To submit a PR, clone the repo, install dependencies and start the dev server to see changes as you make them.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/janosh/svelte-multiselect
cd svelte-multiselect
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

To ensure your changes didn't break anything, run the full test suite (which also runs in CI) with:

```sh
pnpm test
```
