<script>
  import MultiSelect from '$lib'
  import { foods } from '$src/options'

## User interface

<label for="foods">Food Picker</label>
<MultiSelect
  id="foods"
  options={foods}
  placeholder="Pick your favorite foods!"
  removeAllTitle="Delete all foods"
  invalid
/>

```svelte
<MultiSelect
  options={foods}
  placeholder="Pick your favorite foods"
  removeAllTitle="Delete all foods"
  invalid
/>
```

This page is mostly used for testing. It checks that:

- the remove-all button
  - removes all currently selected options from the input
  - only appears if more than 1 element is selected
  - has custom title (if supplied with `removeAllTitle`)
- component can be focused
  - which opens dropdown
  - and closes dropdown when user tabs out of input or clicks/taps outside component
  - importantly, we don't close dropdown when input looses focus
- filters options to only list matches when entering text
- accessibility
  - input is `aria-invalid` when component has `invalid=true`
  - has `aria-expanded='false'` when closed
  - has `aria-expanded='true'` when open
  - options have `aria-selected='false'` and selected items have `aria-selected='true`
  - invisible `input.form-control` is `aria-hidden`
