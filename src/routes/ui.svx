# User interface

This page is mostly used for testing. It checks that:

- the remove-all button
  - removes all currently selected options from the input
  - only appears if more than 1 element is selected
  - has custom title (if supplied with `removeAllTitle`)
- component can be focused
  - which opens dropdown
  - and closes dropdown when input looses focus
- filters options to only list matches when entering text
- accessibility
  - input is `aria-invalid` when component has `invalid=true`
  - has `aria-expanded='false'` when closed
  - has `aria-expanded='true'` when open
  - options have `aria-selected='false'` and selected items have `aria-selected='true`
  - invisible `input.form-control` is `aria-hidden`

```svelte
<MultiSelect
  options={fruits}
  placeholder="Pick your favorite fruits"
  removeAllTitle="Delete all fruits"
  invalid
/>
```

<MultiSelect
  options={fruits}
  placeholder="Pick your favorite fruits"
  removeAllTitle="Delete all fruits"
  invalid
